### New and noteworthy

#### Updated Apex Support

*   The Apex language support has been bumped to version 45 (Spring '19). All new language features are now properly
    parsed and processed.
*   Many nodes now expose more informations, such as the operator for BooleanExpressions. This makes these operators
    consumable by XPath rules, e.g. `//BooleanExpression[@Operator='&&']`.

#### PL/SQL Grammar improvements

*   In this release, many parser bugs in our PL/SQL support have been fixed. This adds e.g. support for
    table collection expressions (`SELECT * FROM TABLE(expr)`).
*   Support for parsing insert statements has been added.
*   More improvements are planned for the next release of PMD.

#### New Rules

*   The new Java rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticformatter) (`java-multithreading`) detects
    unsynchronized usages of static `java.text.Format` instances. This rule is a more generic replacement of the
    rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticdateformatter) which focused just on `DateFormat`.

*   The new Java rule [`ForLoopVariableCount`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#forloopvariablecount) (`java-bestpractices`) checks for
    the number of control variables in a for-loop. Having a lot of control variables makes it harder to understand
    what the loop does. The maximum allowed number of variables is by default 1 and can be configured by a
    property.

*   The new Java rule [`AvoidReassigningLoopVariables`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_bestpractices.html#avoidreassigningloopvariables) (`java-bestpractices`) searches
    for loop variables that are reassigned. Changing the loop variables additionally to the loop itself can lead to
    hard-to-find bugs.

*   The new Java rule [`UseDiamondOperator`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#usediamondoperator) (`java-codestyle`) looks for constructor
    calls with explicit type parameters. Since Java 1.7, these type parameters are not necessary anymore, as they
    can be inferred now.

#### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule [`LocalVariableCouldBeFinal`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_codestyle.html#localvariablecouldbefinal) (`java-codestyle`) has a new
    property `ignoreForEachDecl`, which is by default disabled. The new property allows for ignoring
    non-final loop variables in a for-each statement.

#### Deprecated Rules

*   The Java rule [`UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticdateformatter) has been deprecated and
    will be removed with PMD 7.0.0. The rule is replaced by the more general
    [`UnsynchronizedStaticFormatter`](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-6.11.0/pmd_rules_java_multithreading.html#unsynchronizedstaticformatter).

### API Changes

* [`StatisticalRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/stat/StatisticalRule.html#) and the related helper classes and base rule classes
are deprecated for removal in 7.0.0. This includes all of [`net.sourceforge.pmd.stat`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/stat/package-summary.html#) and [`net.sourceforge.pmd.lang.rule.stat`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/rule/stat/package-summary.html#),
and also [`AbstractStatisticalJavaRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-java/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/AbstractStatisticalJavaRule.html#), [`AbstractStatisticalApexRule`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-apex/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/apex/rule/AbstractStatisticalApexRule.html#) and the like.
The methods [`Report#addMetric`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/Report.html#addMetric(net.sourceforge.pmd.stat.Metric)) and [`metricAdded`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/ThreadSafeReportListener.html#metricAdded(net.sourceforge.pmd.stat.Metric))
will also be removed.
* [`setProperty`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/PropertySource.html#setProperty(net.sourceforge.pmd.properties.MultiValuePropertyDescriptor,Object[])) is deprecated,
because [`MultiValuePropertyDescriptor`](https://javadoc.io/page/net.sourceforge.pmd/pmd-core/6.11.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/properties/MultiValuePropertyDescriptor.html#) is deprecated as well
